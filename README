KT-WWD version 0.50
===================

KT::WWD is the WWD (World Wide Database) client software.  Applications can
use this module to retrieve WWD objects from any Internet connected system.
WWD is a static method for retrieving dynamic data.  The data can be atomic
data, redirected data, or an application that sits behind an object. Objects
can retrieve other objects and produce their output based on other objects.

A WWD object can be shared with the world, or only to a certain user, IP address
or domain name. Temporary passwords can be assigned (good for X seconds, or X
reads). Objects can also be restricted to users who provide the proper read
password. For more information, visit http://idserver.org/wwd
